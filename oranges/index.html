                    I'll choose for myself next time
                    who I'll reach out and take
                    as mine, in the way
                    I might stand at a fruit stall
                    
                    having decided
                    to ignore the apples
                    the mangoes and the kiwis
                    but hold my hands above
                    
                    a pile of oranges
                    as if to warm my skin
                    before a fire.
                    Not only have I chosen
                    
                    oranges, but I'll also choose
                    which orange - I'll test
                    a few for firmness
                    scrape some rind off
                    
                    with my fingernail
                    so that a citrus scent
                    will linger there all day.
                    I won't be happy
                    
                    with the first one I pick
                    but will try different ones
                    until I know you. How
                    will I know you?
                    
                    You'll feel warm
                    between my palms
                    and I'll cup you like
                    a handful of holy water.
                    
                    A vision will come to me
                    of your exotic land: the sun
                    you swelled under
                    the tree you grew from.
                    
                    A drift of white blossoms
                    from the orange tree
                    will settle in my hair
                    and I'll know.
                    
                    This is how I will choose
                    you: by feeling you
                    smelling you, by slipping
                    you into my coat.
                    
                    Maybe then I'll climb
                    the hill, look down
                    on the town we live in
                    with sunlight on my face
                    
                    and a miniature sun
                    burning a hole in my pocket.
                    Thirsty, I'll suck the juice
                    from it. From you.
                    
                    When I walk away
                    I'll leave behind a trail
                    of lamp-bright rind.
