                    I'll choose for myself next time <br>
                    who I'll reach out and take <br>
                    as mine, in the way <br>
                    I might stand at a fruit stall <br>
                    
                    having decided <br>
                    to ignore the apples <br>
                    the mangoes and the kiwis <br>
                    but hold my hands above <br>
                    
                    a pile of oranges <br>
                    as if to warm my skin <br>
                    before a fire. <br>
                    Not only have I chosen <br>
                    
                    oranges, but I'll also choose <br>
                    which orange - I'll test <br>
                    a few for firmness <br>
                    scrape some rind off <br>
                    
                    with my fingernail <br>
                    so that a citrus scent <br>
                    will linger there all day. <br>
                    I won't be happy <br>
                    
                    with the first one I pick <br>
                    but will try different ones <br>
                    until I know you. How <br>
                    will I know you? <br>
                    
                    You'll feel warm <br>
                    between my palms <br>
                    and I'll cup you like <br>
                    a handful of holy water. <br>
                    
                    A vision will come to me <br>
                    of your exotic land: the sun <br>
                    you swelled under <br>
                    the tree you grew from. <br>
                    
                    A drift of white blossoms <br>
                    from the orange tree <br>
                    will settle in my hair <br>
                    and I'll know. <br>
                    
                    This is how I will choose <br>
                    you: by feeling you <br>
                    smelling you, by slipping <br>
                    you into my coat. <br>
                    
                    Maybe then I'll climb <br>
                    the hill, look down <br>
                    on the town we live in <br>
                    with sunlight on my face <br>
                    
                    and a miniature sun <br>
                    burning a hole in my pocket. <br>
                    Thirsty, I'll suck the juice <br>
                    from it. From you. <br>
                    
                    When I walk away <br>
                    I'll leave behind a trail <br>
                    of lamp-bright rind. <br>
